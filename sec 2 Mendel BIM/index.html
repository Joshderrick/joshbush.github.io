<h1> Mangrove Beach</h1>
<h5>
Many things about mangrove:
<br>
<br>
1 Mangroves are important to people,because they help stabilize Florida's coastline ecosystem and prevent erosion.
Mangroves provide natural infrastructure and protection to nearby populated areas 
by preventing erosion and absorbing storm surge impacts during extreme weather events such as hurricanes.
<br>
<br>
2 In the Pantar coast, mangroves are a prevalent plant that have a variety of applications and benefits, including the production of food like chips from the leaves.
 This one plant may be used to produce chips, syrup, soap, coffee, and natural food coloring.
<br>
<br>
3 Apart from that, on the mangrove beach you can also carry out various activities such as planting mangrove trees, catching crabs, driving ATVs
and learn to make chips/cookies from the tiny leaves of mangrove trees.
besides being a fun activity, we can also see the beautiful beach there plus a gentle breeze!
